# Graph Positioning
Define nodes and edges positions of a cycle-less or undirected graph.
## Motivation
The main problem when drawing graphs is to position edges without trespassing nodes. To solve this problem and achieve an optimal solution was utilized A* algorithm and a JSON friendly api to allow easy drawing in front-end programs.
